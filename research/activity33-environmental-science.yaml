    - You've been hired to help redesign River City to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly.
    - ''
    - '**Your mission:**'
    - Make decisions that balance environmental protection, economic needs, and quality of life.
    - ''
    - '**You''ll learn about:**'
    - '- Ecosystem interdependencies'
    - '- Carbon footprint and climate impact'
    - '- Renewable vs non-renewable energy'
    - '- Sustainable urban planning'
    - '- Biodiversity and habitat protection'
    - '- Systems thinking and tradeoffs'
