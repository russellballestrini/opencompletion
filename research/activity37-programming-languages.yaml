    title: Displaying Output
    content_blocks:
    - '## Your First Program: Hello World! 👋'
    - ''
    - '### What is "Hello World"?'
    - The traditional first program in any language is 'Hello World' - a program that displays text to the screen. This tradition dates back to the 1970s and serves as a simple test that your programming environment is working correctly.
    - ''
    - '### Understanding Standard Output (stdout)'
    - ''
    - '**What is stdout?**'
    - 'The term **stdout** (pronounced "standard out") stands for **standard output**. It''s the default destination where programs send their text output. When you run a program in a terminal or console, stdout is what displays on the screen.'
    - ''
    - '**Breaking down the terminology:**'
    - '- **Standard** = The default, conventional way programs handle output'
    - '- **Output** = Information flowing OUT of the program to the user'
    - '- **stdout** = Lowercase shorthand used in programming (also written as STDOUT in some contexts)'
    - ''
    - '**The Three Standard Streams**'
    - 'In Unix/Linux systems (and adopted by Windows), every program has three standard "streams" of data:'
    - ''
    - '1. **stdin (standard input)** - Where programs receive input (usually keyboard)'
    - '2. **stdout (standard output)** - Where programs send normal output (usually screen)'
    - '3. **stderr (standard error)** - Where programs send error messages (usually screen)'
    - ''
    - 'Right now we''re focusing on **stdout** because displaying output is the first thing beginners learn!'
    - ''
    - '**Why is stdout important?**'
    - 'Almost every program needs to communicate with its users. Whether it''s:'
    - '- Displaying calculation results'
    - '- Showing progress updates'
    - '- Presenting information to the user'
    - '- Debugging your code (printing variable values)'
    - ''
    - '...stdout is the fundamental way programs "talk" to people.'
    - ''
    - '**How stdout works:**'
    - ''
    - '```'
    - 'Your Program → stdout → Terminal/Console → Your Screen'
    - '```'
    - ''
    - 'When you write `print("Hello")` in Python or `console.log("Hello")` in JavaScript, you''re sending text to stdout, which the operating system then displays in your terminal window.'
    - ''
    - '**Historical Context**'
    - 'The concept of standard streams comes from Unix in the 1970s. Before graphical interfaces, all computing was done in text terminals. Programs needed a consistent way to:'
    - '- Read input (stdin)'
    - '- Display output (stdout)'
    - '- Report errors (stderr)'
    - ''
    - 'This simple, powerful design is still used today in every programming language!'
    - ''
    - '**Why "standard"?**'
    - 'It''s called "standard" because:'
    - '- Every program automatically has these streams connected when it starts'
    - '- It''s the standard/default way programs communicate'
    - '- It works consistently across different operating systems'
    - '- Other programs can read from or write to these streams (piping, redirection)'
    - ''
    - '**Advanced: Redirection (You don''t need this yet, but it''s cool!)**'
    - 'Because stdout is a "stream," you can redirect it:'
    - '- `program > output.txt` - Send stdout to a file instead of the screen'
    - '- `program1 | program2` - Send program1''s stdout to program2''s stdin'
    - ''
    - 'This is why understanding stdout matters - it''s not just "printing to the screen," it''s sending data to a stream that can go anywhere!'
    - ''
    - '### How Different Languages Display Output'
    - 'Every programming language has its own syntax, but they all accomplish the same goal. Here are examples across different languages:'
    - ''
    - '**Python:** Uses `print()` function'
    - '```python'
    - 'print("Hello, World!")'
    - '```'
    - ''
    - '**JavaScript:** Uses `console.log()` function'
    - '```javascript'
    - 'console.log("Hello, World!");'
    - '```'
    - ''
    - '**Java:** Uses `System.out.println()` method'
    - '```java'
    - 'System.out.println("Hello, World!");'
    - '```'
    - ''
    - '**C++:** Uses `std::cout` stream'
    - '```cpp'
    - 'std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;'
    - '```'
    - ''
    - '**Key Concept:** Notice that while the syntax differs, each language has a way to send text to stdout. The quotes around "Hello, World!" indicate it''s a **string** (text data).'
    - ''
    - '### Now It''s Your Turn!'
    question: How do you display 'Hello, World!' to stdout in your chosen language? Write the complete code.

    - '### Building on What You''ve Learned'
    - Great! Now that you can display one message, let's display multiple messages. This is a fundamental skill because real programs often need to show multiple pieces of information.
    - ''
    - '### Two Ways to Display Multiple Lines'
    - ''
    - '**Method 1: Multiple Output Statements**'
    - You can call your output function multiple times in sequence. Each call displays one line.

    - '```python'
    - 'print("First line")'
    - 'print("Second line")'
    - 'print("Third line")'
    - '```'
    - ''
    - '**Method 2: Newline Characters**'
    - Many languages support special characters like `\n` (newline) that create line breaks within a single string.
    - ''
    - '**Example in Python:**'
    - '```python'
    - 'print("First line\nSecond line\nThird line")'
    - '```'
    - ''
    - '### Understanding Newlines'
    - The `\n` is called an "escape sequence" - a special character that represents a line break. When the computer sees `\n`, it moves to the next line.'
    - ''
    - '**Why use multiple statements vs newlines?**'

    - '## Variables: Storing Information 📦'
    - ''
    - '### What Are Variables?'
    - Variables are one of the most fundamental concepts in programming. A variable is a named storage location in your computer''s memory that holds a value. Think of it as a labeled container where you can store information and retrieve it later.
    - ''
    - '### Why Do We Need Variables?'

    - '- **Reusable:** Use the same value in multiple places'
    - '- **Maintainable:** Change the value in one place, and it updates everywhere'
    - '- **Dynamic:** The value can change while the program runs'

    - '- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores'
    - '- Cannot use reserved words (like `if`, `for`, `while`)'
    - '- **Case-sensitive:** `name` and `Name` are different variables'

    - '### What Are Data Types?'
    - 'Just as in real life we have different kinds of information (names, ages, prices, yes/no answers), programming has different **data types** to represent different kinds of values. The type of data determines what operations you can perform on it.'
    - ''
    - '### Why Data Types Matter'
    - 'Data types tell the computer:'
    - '- How much memory to allocate'
    - '- What operations are valid (you can add numbers, but adding text doesn''t make mathematical sense)'
    - '- How to interpret the bits in memory'
    - ''
    - 'For example: `"25" + "10"` (strings) might give `"2510"` (concatenation), but `25 + 10` (numbers) gives `35` (addition).'
    - ''
    - '### The Four Fundamental Data Types'
    - ''
    - '**1. Strings (Text)**'
    - '- Represent text and characters'
    - '- Enclosed in quotes: `"hello"`, `''world''`, `"Alice"`'
    - '- Can contain letters, numbers, spaces, symbols'
    - '- Examples: names, addresses, messages, file paths'
    - ''
    - '**2. Integers (Whole Numbers)**'
    - '- Whole numbers without decimal points'
    - '- Can be positive, negative, or zero'
    - '- Examples: `42`, `-17`, `0`, `1000`'
    - '- Used for: counting, indexing, discrete quantities'
    - ''
    - '**3. Floats/Doubles (Decimal Numbers)**'
    - '- Numbers with decimal points'
    - '- More precision for measurements'
    - '- Examples: `3.14`, `-0.5`, `2.71828`, `1.75`'
    - '- Used for: measurements, prices, scientific calculations'
    - '- Note: "Float" = single precision, "Double" = double precision'
    - ''
    - '**4. Booleans (True/False)**'
    - '- Only two possible values: `true` or `false`'

    - 'boolean isStudent = true;  // Boolean type'
    - '```'

    - '- Type is inferred automatically from the value'
    - '- Variables can hold different types at different times'

    question: Write a function called 'add' that takes two numbers as parameters, returns their sum, and then call it with 5 and 3 and display the result to stdout.
    tokens_for_ai: 'Check their function with return value.


      Should have:

      - Function named ''add''

      - Takes two parameters (numbers)

      - Returns the sum

      - Function is called with 5 and 3

      - Result is displayed to stdout

      - correct: Valid function with return, called correctly, result displayed
