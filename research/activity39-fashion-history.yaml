                Exactly - society wanted women back in traditional roles after the war.
                Returning soldiers needed jobs, so women were pushed back to domesticity.
                Ultra-feminine fashion was part of that push.
                The "perfect housewife" image was propaganda!
                But women had tasted freedom... the 1960s would change everything!

                Yes! This was absolutely about gender politics.
                Society tried to make women more 'feminine' = more domestic.
                Full skirts and pearls while vacuuming was the ideal.
                Fashion reflected the pressure to conform.

                After the war, society pushed traditional gender roles again.
                Fashion was used to make women look ultra-feminine and domestic.

                TikTok can make something viral overnight.
                Fast fashion tries to keep up - environmental disaster!

                Social media creates constant comparison and pressure.
                Everyone curates their best looks online.
                FOMO about trends, outfits, appearing 'on point.'
                This has mental health impacts, especially for young people.
