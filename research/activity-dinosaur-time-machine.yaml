                For sauropods, emphasize:
                - Mind-boggling size (use comparisons: school buses, etc.)
                - How they ate so much (special digestive systems)
                - Why they had long necks (reaching high vegetation)
                - Social behavior (herds for protection)

                For theropods, emphasize:
                - Hunting strategies
                - Speed and agility
                - Comparison to modern animals

                For Archaeopteryx, emphasize:
                - The link between dinosaurs and birds
                - Feathers AND teeth AND claws
                - Could it fly? (Still debated!)

                ICHTHYOSAURS:
                - Looked like dolphins but were reptiles!
                - Fast swimmers, air-breathers
                - Gave birth to live young (not eggs!)
                - Some had HUGE eyes for deep-water hunting

                PLESIOSAURS:
                - Long necks, four flippers
                - "Flew" through water like penguins
                - Ambush predators

                PLIOSAURS:
                - SHORT necks, MASSIVE heads
                - Some of the most powerful bite forces ever
                - Apex predators of the seas

                Emphasize: These were NOT dinosaurs! They were marine reptiles.
                Dinosaurs lived on land (and some evolved into birds).

                KEY POINTS:
                - NOT dinosaurs! Separate group of reptiles
                - NOT birds! Completely different evolution
                - Hollow bones for lightweight flight
                - Wings made of skin membrane (like bats)
                - Covered in fur-like fibers (pycnofibers)

                JURASSIC PTEROSAURS:
                - Ranged from sparrow-sized to eagle-sized
                - Long tails with diamond-shaped vanes (for steering)
                - Sharp teeth for catching fish
                - Some lived on cliffs, others in forests

                Compare to Cretaceous pterosaurs (like Quetzalcoatlus) which got MUCH bigger!

                Paint a vivid picture of the Jurassic world:

                CLIMATE:
                - Warm and humid everywhere
                - Tropical conditions even at high latitudes
                - Frequent rain created lush forests
                - No ice caps at the poles!
                - Perfect conditions for giant plant-eaters

                GEOGRAPHY:
                - Pangaea breaking up into Laurasia (north) and Gondwana (south)
                - Atlantic Ocean forming as a narrow sea
                - Shallow seas covering parts of continents
                - More coastline = more ecological niches = more diversity

                This breakup of Pangaea meant different dinosaurs evolved
                in different regions - the beginning of regional differences!

                Describe Jurassic plant life vividly:

                FORESTS:
                - Dense conifer forests (think redwood forests!)
                - Some trees reached 200+ feet (60m) tall
                - Araucaria trees (like modern monkey puzzle trees)
                - Ginkgo trees with fan-shaped leaves

                UNDERSTORY:
                - Ferns everywhere - some tree-sized!
                - Cycads with palm-like fronds
                - Horsetails along streams
                - Mosses and liverworts

                IMPORTANT:
                - NO GRASS - the ground was covered in ferns and low plants
                - NO FLOWERS - flowering plants haven't evolved yet
                - This affected how herbivores ate - they needed special teeth
                  to process tough, fibrous vegetation

                Blow their minds with SIZE FACTS:

                LARGEST DINOSAURS:
                - Brachiosaurus: 85 feet long, 40-50 tons (8-10 elephants!)
                - Diplodocus: 90 feet long (longer than 2 school buses!)
                - Supersaurus: 110+ feet long, 40-50 tons

                WHY SO BIG?
                - High oxygen levels
                - Abundant food (lush forests)
                - Efficient respiratory systems (like birds)
                - Long necks let them eat more without moving
                - Size protected them from predators

                HOW DID THEY SUPPORT THEIR WEIGHT?
                - Hollow bones (like birds!)
                - Column-like legs (like elephants)
                - Strong, reinforced vertebrae
                - Massive muscles

                SIZE COMPARISONS:
                - A Brachiosaurus could look into a 4th-story window!
                - One Diplodocus egg weighed about 1 pound
                - A human would barely reach their ankles

                Give them the FULL, AMAZING story of Tyrannosaurus Rex!

                BASICS:
                - Name means "Tyrant Lizard King" 👑
                - 40 feet (12m) long, 12-15 feet (4m) tall at the hips
                - Weighed 9 tons (18,000 pounds!)
                - Lived 68-66 million years ago (very end of Cretaceous)

                INCREDIBLE FEATURES:
                - 🦷 60 teeth, some 12 inches (30cm) long!
                - 👀 EXCELLENT eyesight (better than eagles!) - 13x better than humans
                - 👃 Amazing sense of smell (could smell prey from miles away)
                - 🦴 Bite force: 12,800 pounds (strongest of any land animal ever!)
                - 🏃 Could run 25 mph (40 km/h) - fast for its size!

                HUNTING:
                - Apex predator - ate Triceratops, Edmontosaurus, and other large dinosaurs
                - Possibly hunted in family groups
                - Could crush bone with its bite
                - Both hunter AND scavenger (ate whatever it could!)

                TINY ARMS:
                - Yes, its arms were small (3 feet / 1m)
                - BUT very strong! Could lift 400 pounds each
                - Likely used for gripping prey while biting
                - Two-fingered hands with claws

                COOL FACTS:
                - Only lived for 2 million years before extinction
                - Grew incredibly fast (4,000 pounds per year during teenage years!)
                - Some had feathers or fuzz (debated)
                - Close relative to modern chickens and ostriches!

                MOSASAURUS:
                - The ultimate marine predator of the Cretaceous!
                - 50 feet (15m) long - longer than a humpback whale
                - Gigantic jaws with hundreds of teeth
                - Ate EVERYTHING: fish, turtles, plesiosaurs, even other mosasaurs
                - Could swallow prey whole
                - Ruled the seas for 20 million years

                ELASMOSAURUS:
                - Ridiculously long neck (26 feet / 8m!)
                - 72 vertebrae in the neck alone
                - Total length: 34 feet (10m)
                - Swam using four flippers like a sea turtle
                - Ambush predator - would raise head quickly to catch fish

                CONTEXT:
                - The seas were warm and shallow
                - Abundant fish and ammonites (spiral-shelled creatures)
                - These weren't dinosaurs - they were marine reptiles
                - All went extinct with the dinosaurs 66 MYA

                Paint a picture of the ancient seas!

                PTERANODON:
                - Most famous pterosaur
                - 20-foot (6m) wingspan
                - Distinctive head crest (for display or steering?)
                - Toothless beak
                - Soared over oceans catching fish
                - Light as a turkey despite huge size!

                QUETZALCOATLUS:
                - The LARGEST flying animal EVER! 🤯
                - 35-40 foot (10-12m) wingspan!
                - As tall as a giraffe when standing
                - Weighed 500 pounds (like a male lion)
                - How did it fly? Incredible lightweight skeleton
                - Likely hunted on ground too (ate baby dinosaurs?)

                HOW THEY FLEW:
                - Wings made of skin membrane (like bats)
                - Covered in fur-like pycnofibers
                - Hollow bones (even more hollow than birds!)
                - Enormous flight muscles
                - Could soar for hours without flapping

                Emphasize the SCALE - Quetzalcoatlus had wingspan of a small airplane!

                Explain the REVOLUTION of flowering plants:

                THE BIG CHANGE:
                - Around 130 million years ago, flowers appeared!
                - This changed EVERYTHING about life on Earth
                - Charles Darwin called it an "abominable mystery" (happened so fast!)

                EARLY FLOWERS:
                - Magnolias (still exist today!)
                - Water lilies
                - Small daisy-like flowers
                - Eventually: roses, orchids, oaks, maples

                WHY IT MATTERED:
                - Flowers = fruits and seeds
                - More nutritious food for herbivores
                - Led to evolution of bees, butterflies, and other pollinators
                - Faster reproduction than conifers
                - Quickly dominated the landscape

                EFFECTS ON DINOSAURS:
                - Duck-billed dinosaurs evolved to eat flowering plants
                - More diverse food sources = more diverse dinosaurs
                - Some dinosaurs may have helped spread seeds (like modern elephants)

                THE CASCADE:
                - Flowers → insects → small mammals thrived
                - This set the stage for mammal dominance after dinosaurs

                Make it feel like the evolutionary revolution it was!

                Describe the Cretaceous world vividly:

                GEOGRAPHY:
                - Continents starting to look familiar!
                - Atlantic Ocean wide and growing
                - India is an island moving toward Asia
                - North America split by Western Interior Seaway
                - South America and Africa separated

                CLIMATE:
                - Very warm globally - no ice caps!
                - Tropical conditions extended far north/south
                - Sea levels 550 feet (170m) higher than today!
                - Shallow seas covered 40% of the continents
                - Seasonal monsoons in some regions

                REGIONAL DIFFERENCES:
                - Different dinosaurs on different continents
                - North America: T-Rex, Triceratops
                - South America: Giganotosaurus, Argentinosaurus
                - Africa: Spinosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus
                - Asia: Velociraptor, Protoceratops

                This geographic isolation led to incredible diversity!

                Explain the dinosaur-to-bird connection with excitement:

                THE DISCOVERY:
                - In the 1990s-2000s, fossils from China revealed FEATHERED dinosaurs!
                - Many theropods (meat-eaters) had feathers
                - Some just for warmth, some for display, some for flight

                FEATHERED DINOSAURS:
                - Velociraptors had feathers! (movie got it wrong)
                - Microraptor had four wings!
                - Yutyrannus - a feathered tyrannosaur relative
                - Even baby T-Rexes may have been fuzzy

                EVOLUTION TO BIRDS:
                - Birds ARE dinosaurs (specifically, avian dinosaurs)
                - They evolved from small theropods
                - Hollow bones, wishbones, three-toed feet
                - The first birds appeared in the Jurassic (Archaeopteryx)
                - By Cretaceous, many modern bird groups existed

                SURVIVORS:
                - When the asteroid hit, only bird dinosaurs survived
                - Why? Small size, could fly, ate seeds/insects
                - Every bird today is a living dinosaur!
                - You're looking at a dinosaur when you see a chicken

                This means dinosaurs DIDN'T go extinct - they're all around us!

                Provide more details about the K-T extinction:
                - The debate about what killed them (asteroid confirmed in 1980s)
                - How we know (iridium layer worldwide, shocked quartz, tektites)
                - Chicxulub crater discovery
                - Why it affected different animals differently
                - Alternative theories that were disproven
                - Whether it could happen again (yes, but rare)

                End by asking if they want to explore more or return to control room.

                Explain what happened after the dinosaurs:

                THE PALEOGENE (66-23 MYA):
                - Mammals rapidly evolved to fill ecological niches
                - From mouse-sized to elephant-sized in 10 million years
                - Early whales, early horses, early primates
                - Birds diversified into modern groups
                - Earth cooled down, forests recovered

                THE AGE OF MAMMALS:
                - Primates evolved from small shrew-like mammals
                - First apes appeared ~20 MYA
                - First humans ~2 MYA
                - Modern humans ~300,000 years ago

                PERSPECTIVE:
                - Dinosaurs ruled for 165 million years
                - Humans have only existed for 300,000 years
                - We're VERY new to this planet!

                End by asking what else they'd like to explore.
