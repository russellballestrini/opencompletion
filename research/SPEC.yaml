# ==============================================================================
# SECTIONS
# ==============================================================================
# Activities are organized into sections, which contain steps
# Required: At least one section

sections:
  # Each section must have a unique section_id
  - section_id: "introduction"  # REQUIRED - Unique identifier
    title: "Getting Started"    # REQUIRED - Human-readable title

    # Steps are the individual interactions within a section
    steps:
      # ========================================================================
      # STEP TYPE 1: CONTENT-ONLY STEP
      # ========================================================================
      # Displays information and automatically advances
      # No user interaction required

      - step_id: "welcome"           # REQUIRED - Unique within this section
        title: "Welcome"             # REQUIRED - Human-readable title

        # Content blocks are displayed to the user
        # Supports markdown formatting
        content_blocks:               # REQUIRED for content-only steps
          - "# Welcome to the Activity! 🎉"
          - ""
          - "This activity will teach you about [TOPIC]."
          - ""

          - "- Concept 3"
          - ""
          - "Let's get started!"

        # Content-only steps automatically advance to the next step
        # No question, buckets, or transitions needed

      # ========================================================================
      # STEP TYPE 2: QUESTION STEP
      # ========================================================================
      # Interactive step that requires user response

      - step_id: "question_example"
        title: "Your First Question"

        # Optional: Content blocks can appear before the question
        content_blocks:
          - "## Background Information"
          - "Before we ask the question, here's some context..."

        # The question asked to the user
        question: "What is your name?"  # REQUIRED for question steps

        # Instructions for the AI on how to categorize the user's response
        # The AI will read this and place the response into one of the buckets
        tokens_for_ai: |              # REQUIRED for question steps
          Categorize the user's response:

          - name_provided: They gave a name (any name is acceptable)
          - set_language: They want to change language preference
          - off_topic: Their response is unrelated to the question

          Be generous in accepting names - nicknames, full names, etc.

        # Instructions for generating feedback after categorization
        # This is used when creating ai_feedback in transitions
        feedback_tokens_for_ai: |     # Optional but recommended
          Welcome the user by their name warmly!
          Make them feel comfortable and ready to learn.

          Example: "Welcome, [name]! Great to have you here!"

        # List of possible categories (buckets) for user responses
        # Every response will be categorized into one of these

        # ======================================================================
        # Probabilistic events that can trigger alongside user responses
        # Random rolls happen BEFORE categorization
        # Multiple random buckets can trigger simultaneously

          bonus:
            probability: 0.03          # 3% chance

        # Processing Order:
        # 1. Random buckets rolled
        # 2. User response categorized
        # 3. User's bucket processed FIRST
        # 4. Random buckets processed in order they triggered
        # 5. Metadata accumulates across all transitions

# TERMINATION PATTERNS
# ==============================================================================
# Activities can terminate in several ways

  - section_id: "conclusion"
    title: "Wrap Up"
    steps:
      # ========================================================================
      # TERMINATION 1: Content-Only Final Step
      # ========================================================================
      # Simplest termination - just display content

      - step_id: "goodbye_content"
        title: "Thank You!"
        content_blocks:
          - "# Thank You for Participating! 🎉"

          - "You've completed the activity!"
          - "Your final score: check metadata.score"
          - ""
          - "Come back anytime!"
        # No question = auto-terminates

      # ========================================================================
      # TERMINATION 2: Final Reflection Question
      # ========================================================================
      # Last question with no onward navigation

      - step_id: "reflection"
        title: "Final Reflection"
        question: "What did you learn today?"
        tokens_for_ai: |
          Categorize their reflection as:
          - thoughtful: Deep, meaningful reflection
          - brief: Short but genuine
          - off_topic: Not answering the question
        buckets: [thoughtful, brief, off_topic]
        transitions:
          thoughtful:

      # ========================================================================
      # TERMINATION 3: Explicit Exit Path
      # ========================================================================
      # Provide clear exit option

      - step_id: "play_again"
        title: "Continue?"
        question: "Would you like to play again or exit?"
        tokens_for_ai: "Categorize as 'again' or 'exit'"
        buckets: [again, exit]
        transitions:

# ==============================================================================
# METADATA SPECIAL VALUES
# ==============================================================================
# Reference guide for all metadata operations

# String Operations:
# ------------------
# "the-users-response"         → Exact text of user's answer
# "n+,value"                   → Append to comma-separated list
# "n-,value"                   → Remove from comma-separated list

# Numeric Operations:
# -------------------
# "n+5"                        → Add 5 to existing value (or 0)
# "n-3"                        → Subtract 3 from existing value
# "n+random(1,10)"             → Add random number between 1 and 10

# Static Values:
# --------------
# "any string"                 → Store literal string
# 42                           → Store integer
# true / false                 → Store boolean

# ==============================================================================
# VALIDATION RULES
# ==============================================================================

# REQUIRED:
# ---------
# ✓ Every activity must have "sections" (at least one)
# ✓ Every section needs: section_id, title, steps
# ✓ Every step needs: step_id, title
# ✓ Every step needs EITHER content_blocks OR question (or both)
# ✓ Steps with questions need: buckets, transitions, tokens_for_ai
# ✓ Every bucket must have a corresponding transition
# ✓ All next_section_and_step targets must exist

# FORBIDDEN:
# ----------
# ✗ Terminal steps (no next_section_and_step) CANNOT have questions
# ✗ Section IDs must be unique within activity
# ✗ Step IDs must be unique within section
# ✗ Random bucket names must exist in main buckets list
# ✗ Random bucket probabilities must be 0.0 to 1.0

# WARNINGS:
# ---------
# ⚠ Total random bucket probability > 1.0 (overlapping events)
# ⚠ Circular loops without exit path
# ⚠ Python syntax errors in processing scripts

# ==============================================================================
# BEST PRACTICES
# ==============================================================================

# 1. START SIMPLE
#    - Begin with content-only steps and simple questions
#    - Add complexity incrementally
#    - Test frequently with CLI simulator

# 2. CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS
#    - Write specific tokens_for_ai that explain each bucket clearly
#    - Give examples of what qualifies for each category
#    - Be generous in accepting valid responses

# 3. METADATA STRATEGY
#    - Track meaningful state: score, progress, user choices
#    - Use descriptive key names: "programming_language" not "pl"
#    - Clean up temporary metadata with metadata_tmp_add

# 4. RANDOM EVENTS
#    - Use probabilities that feel right (5-15% for rare events)
#    - Set counts_as_attempt: false for random buckets
#    - Don't override user navigation unless necessary

# 5. FEEDBACK QUALITY
#    - Reference specific parts of user's answer
#    - Provide actionable suggestions for improvement
#    - Celebrate progress and effort

# 6. TERMINATION
#    - Always provide clear path to completion
#    - Mark completion: metadata_add: activity_completed: "true"
#    - Give users a sense of accomplishment

# 7. TESTING
#    - Validate YAML: python activity_yaml_validator.py your_activity.yaml
#    - Test all paths: source vars.sh && python research/guarded_ai.py your_activity.yaml
#    - Try wrong answers, edge cases, language switching

# ==============================================================================
# MODEL CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================

# Environment Variables (in vars.sh):
# ------------------------------------
# MODEL_ENDPOINT_1=http://localhost:8080/v1
# MODEL_API_KEY_1=your-api-key
# MODEL_NAME_1=model  # Optional: actual model name for endpoint
#
# MODEL_ENDPOINT_2=http://localhost:8081/v1
# MODEL_API_KEY_2=your-api-key
# MODEL_NAME_2=gpt-4
#
# MODEL_ENDPOINT_3=http://localhost:8082/v1
# MODEL_API_KEY_3=your-api-key
# MODEL_NAME_3=model

# Recommended Models:
# -------------------
# MODEL_1: Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B (default, fast, excellent for classification)
# MODEL_2: Larger general model (if available)
# MODEL_3: Qwen3-Coder-30B (for programming activities)

# Model Selection Strategy:
# -------------------------
# - Classifier: Use MODEL_1 (fast 8B model) for instant categorization
# - Feedback: Use specialized model for domain-specific feedback
#   - Programming → MODEL_3 (Qwen3-Coder)
#   - General → MODEL_1 (Hermes)
#   - Advanced reasoning → MODEL_2 (larger model)
