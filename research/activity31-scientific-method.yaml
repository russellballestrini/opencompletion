    - '**Key principles for good science:**'
    - ''
    - ✓ **Use controls** - Compare to a baseline or control group
    - ✓ **Use placebos** - Control for psychological effects
    - ✓ **Blind studies** - Subjects don't know if they got real treatment
    - ✓ **Double-blind** - Researchers also don't know (prevents their bias)
    - ✓ **Replicate** - Repeat experiments to confirm results
    - ✓ **Peer review** - Other scientists check your work
    - ✓ **Large sample sizes** - More data = more reliable
    - ✓ **Account for confounding variables** - What else might affect results?
    - ''
    - These principles help ensure that scientific findings are reliable and trustworthy.
    question: Why do you think it's important for other scientists to be able to replicate (repeat) an experiment? What purpose does replication serve in science?

      - Verifying results weren''t due to chance
