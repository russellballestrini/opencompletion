          Engage complex transformation. Jesus didn't defeat Rome (political messianism failed),
          so followers reinterpreted: spiritual not political kingdom, suffering messiah, second
          coming. Paul removed Jewish law requirements, making it accessible to Gentiles. Temple
          destruction ended Jerusalem-based Jewish Christianity. This is one of history's great
          religious transformations.
